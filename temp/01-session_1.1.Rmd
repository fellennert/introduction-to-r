## R

For downloading R, just visit the website of the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org). CRAN is simply a network of ftp and web servers all around the world. Here, things related to R (code, documentation, etc.) are stored and can be downloaded. 
On top of the page, you will find a box with three links that refer to different versions depending on your operating system. Choose the one that applies. 

![The CRAN webpage -- choose the right operating system](figures/cran_1.png) 

Thereafter, just click the link for downloading the latest version (we will work with R 4.1.0). If you are on a Mac (as I am), it will look like this: 

![The CRAN webpage -- download the latest version](figures/cran_2.png) 

After the download is finished, just execute the installer and, once it is done, you can proceed with the installation of RStudio. 

New versions of R are released multiple times per year. If you want to update your R, the process is the same as installing it from scratch: go to [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org), download the latest version, install it, and that is basically it.

## RStudio

### Download and installation

When you are on a Windows or Mac machine and you click the R icon, a window (the so-called Mac or Windows GUI -- graphic user interface) that looks pretty much like your machine's terminal will appear. You could now just type R code in there and execute it -- and, in fact, that is how the users did it the ancient way. In my opinion, this is fairly inconvenient. Luckily, we have progressed a lot from that and come up with IDEs (integrated development environments) for R. The most popular among them is RStudio which we will use as well.

To install RStudio, just click on [this link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), choose the right version (i.e., RStudio Desktop -- Open Source License), and hit the download button. After downloading it, you simply install it, and then you are good to go.

### Setting up RStudio

After installing RStudio, you can open it just like every other application on your machine. When you open it for the very first time, a window will appear that looks like this:

![RStudio; obtained from @grolemund2014](figures/rstudio.png)

As you can see, there are three panes. When you open a script (for instance, by clicking File >> New File >> R Script), a fourth one will appear in the upper part on the left side. If you open multiple scripts, they will be organized in tabs as well^[more on scripts at the end of session 1.2.].  

Every pane contains different things:    

* By default, the console can be found in the lower left pane. This is basically how the GUI would look like. You can either manually enter commands, and execute them by pressing return, or write code in the script (upper left pane), and run it by either clicking "Run" or hitting cmd/ctrl+return (Mac/Windows). Then, the console will show, (1), the code you ran and, (2), depending on what you executed, the output.    
* In the upper right pane, there are two tabs: the environment and the history. The former will show you all the objects you have defined, the latter all the commands you have executed.  
* The lower left pane now consists of four tabs: "Files" simply shows you the files that are stored in the working direction you are in. "Plots" is only used if you have plotted something -- and is then called automatically, so you will probably never click on it. In "Packages", as the name hints on, all the packages that are installed are listed. In theory, you could call them from there as well -- but I strongly recommend not to. And finally, the "Help" tab provides you with documentations of packages etc. This sounds handy, but I hardly use it -- simple googling or calling the `?[name_of_function]` has worked out best for me so far.

In the following, I will tell you more about what has appeared to work best *FOR ME*:

**Disclaimer: Every useR has their own preferences when it comes to their setup. Hence, you should see the following paragraphs only as recommendations that originate from my experience.**

As you may have noticed, there are a lot of different things RStudio provides you with. However, in every-day use, you will mostly use these five: the script you are actually working on. The console for seeing what your code has produced. The environment for a quick overview of the objects you are actually working with. The "Files" section for seeing the files in your working directory (this is where R projects will come in extremely handy). The "Plots" section for seeing your visualizations.  
As the latter opens by itself as soon as you plot something, I mainly use the former four. However, if you use RStudio projects -- as you definitely should -- you will only occasionally need the "Files" section. Furthermore, your screen is wider than it is high. Hence, vertical space is scarcer than horizontal. At the heart of your coding lies your script, you should therefore give it the utmost space possible. On the right then there is space for two panes you will always have to give quick glimpses: the console and the environment. I put the former to the bottom and the latter on top. When the "Plots" section opens up, you will manually have to return to your former tab. Therefore, I put it to the lower left side where it does not bother me and I can minimize it with one click when I do not need it anymore.

My RStudio layout looks like this:

How you accomplish this? `Preferences >> Pane Layout`.

Other strongly recommended settings (ordered by Options section):

* `General`: Never save your work space, this makes you lazy (read more [here](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html))
* `Code`: some "Display" settings make your life easier; also set default encoding to UTF-8 in the "Save" section  
* `Appearance`: check out some themes (I use: RStudio theme "Modern", Editor font "Courier", Font size 11, and Editor theme "Cobalt") 
* `Panes layout`: feel free to set them up the way I did
